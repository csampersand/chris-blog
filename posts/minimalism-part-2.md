It's been over 6 months since [I posted about being interested in minimalism](/posts/minimalism-part-1).

And I assure you, the result has been lifechanging.

So in the last post I listed a very abbreviated wardrobe. Not only have I managed to downsize to the aforementioned list, but I've also gotten rid of all of my furniture, dishes, appliances, electronics, etc.

I now live out of a single 34L backpack containing the bare essentials.

That includes the clothes, laptop, toiletries, and a few small quality-of-life items.

Having traveled 4 weeks in Thailand with a similar setup, it hasn't taken much adjustment.

The biggest downside is obviously that I now depend on wherever I'm staying to provide a bed and means of making food.

The upsides make this worthwhile in my unique situation.

## Nomadism

For one, this has allowed me to essentially become nomadic.

My work is completely remote and my phone has unlimited hotspot, so I'm able to work from wherever.

Right now I travel mostly between Orlando, Atlanta, and Fort Lauderdale. But in the near future, I hope to make the jump to Southeast Asia. Probably starting in Thailand, and moving on to Vietnam and then India whenever their borders open up.

## Financial freedom

Upon making the jump to Southeast Asia, my cost-of-living will drop to under $12,000/year. If I'm living out of cheap hostels and being conservative with my spending, I will be able to travel sustainably for a tiny fraction of what it used to cost me to live in an apartment in midtown Atlanta.

This allows me to pursue riskier ventures without having to stress about paying bills. If I want, I can just stop working for a several months and explore carefree. Or I can pick up a remote job, bust my ass, and invest with the money I don't spend.

## Mental clarity

This has actually been less noticeable than I expected.

Yes, it's freeing having fewer earthly possessions. I have less to account for and worry about.

But on the flipside, living with so little takes considerable effort in a different way.

I have to be much more conscious of what I buy. If it doesn't fit in my backpack, I can't take it with me. I can't stock up on food or toiletries in bulk from Costco like I used to. Instead, I have to buy things on the go as I need them.

I'm sure it will get easier as I get used to it.
