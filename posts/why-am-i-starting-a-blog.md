> "Action expresses priorities."

A lot of people can leave it at that, but I'm a chronic overanalyzer and for me things need to be put into words.

This post, and this whole blog really, are my way of doing that. For the past couple weeks, after reflecting on Simon Sinek's _Start With Why_, I have been doing an exercise before embarking on any project or quest.

Whenever I have a new idea, I work backwards by asking myself the following three questions:

1. **Why?**
2. **How?**
3. **What?**

Usually, if left to my own devices, I start with "What?" It's easy to come up with random, _interesting_ ideas. I do it all the time. Coming up with _what_ to work on is cake.

But taking the time to explore _why_ I would want to work on an idea has not only given me insight into my own values and motivations, it's helped me prune things that I don't need to be working on. Mute the noise. Trim the fat.

So it only makes sense to base my inaugural blog post on these three questions.

## Why?

It took a second for me to figure this out. I've always wanted to start a blog. I've been reading them forever, and it seemed like it could be a fun hobby.

Because it's fun, it has **intrinsic value**. That is the first "why." Nothing external needs to come out of this. I don't need it to make me any money or further my career at all. Even if it doesn't take off, I'll still enjoy doing it.

**Vulnerability** is a second "why". Vulnerability is not easy, but it's something I've been practicing. Historically, I've been pretty reserved when it comes to sharing my own thoughts and emotions. I would keep conversations light and shallow. This has protected me ever receiving negative feedback or criticism, but it has also kept me from being truly _seen_. Perhaps worse, it has prevented me from getting to explore my own ideas, opinions, and values. By making a blog and publishing my real feelings and thoughts on it, I am opening myself up to whoever wants to see.

Finally, this blog is an **opportunity for learning**. I am learning to communicate my ideas more clearly and concisely. By forcing me clarify my thoughts for the benefit of readers, I am also gaining clarity for myself in what I really think. They say you learn best by teaching, and while I certainly don't have the credentials or authority to teach anybody anything, I am reaping the benefits by at least trying to transfer the knowledge and ideas I have to whoever is reading this.

## How and What?

Once I've really clarified my _why_, the _how_ and the _what_ really fall into place.

The _how_, in this case, is by creating a platform to share my ideas publicly. A blog.

The _what_? We'll see. I have all kinds of content I would love to write about. What's next is finding out what I actually enjoy writing about, what I'm good at writing about, and getting better at writing about whatever I enjoy writing about.

I'd say "I hope you'll join me" but I know for a fact that nobody is reading this yet because it's my first blog post.

And for those of you reading this after I've gotten famous and have millions of followers, yeah no shit my writing used to be terrible. Everyone starts somewhere.
