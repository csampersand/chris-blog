Formation of an identity is what allows a movement to be poisoned by toxicity. Before you even know what happened, you can easily find yourself associated with an organization that commits hate crimes, witch hunts, and acts of violence of its own: the very actions that your movement originally claimed to be against.

The solution to this is not an easy one. It is the hard choice. To think and educate yourself independent of an organization. To not fall into laziness and let the mob mentality sweep you into a frenzy.

You're learning that the hard way.

Yesterday your nation erupted into outrage. A man by the name of George Floyd was filmed being killed by asphyxiation by a police officer.

You enjoy asphyxiation under the right circumstances, both giving and receiving. But under a very different context, and usually with a safe word.

Today you march with your fellow citizens. The police force has gone too far. It's time for change.

Twitter quickly filled you in with the dirty details. 3pm, the state Capitol. You march for freedom from your oppressors. No justice, no peace.

You arrive to a scene already in full-swing. The energy is palpable. People march beside you as you chant your demands. Righteous anger fills the air, and you feel like you're a part of something big. Something real. Something that will finally make a difference.

Police arrive on the scene, but are quickly cowed by the vast crowd that has assembled to demand justice for your fallen comrade.

You're invincible. Unstoppable.

You march for a better tomorrow. For respect for your fellow citizens. For yourself. Your children. Your family.

Someone smashes a car window next to you. You jump back in surprise.

It happens so quickly you barely process a hooded, masked woman throw a molotov cocktail through the broken window of the car. It takes seconds before the propellant causes the interior of the car to erupt into flames.

Shaken by what you just witnessed, you stumble forward as the crowd surges on. No justice, no peace.

Before long, you come across a wall of protestors stopped in front of you. They've ceased their marching and formed a circle around something. You push through the crowd to see.

A police officer, separated from his unit, tripped and fell and quickly was enveloped by your company of justice seekers.

Several hooded protestors taking turns kicking him. He tries to get up, to push through, but is thrown back to the ground. A boot hits him square in the face. You see teeth and blood scatter from his mouth.

You can't stand to watch, and go to leave, but the crowd is surging forward now. Pressing ever forward. No justice, no peace.

You arrive at the CNN building. A police precinct lies inside, as well as several other businesses and storefronts. The CNN building is its own mini metropolis, usually a bustling hub at the center of a bustling city. It represents everything you stand against. The establishment. The system.

Right now, it looks like a scene from Mad Max. Spray paint marks the red and white letters of the news company logo. Several hooded figures stand on the letters, with the crowd pressed around them. Protestors are breaking the giant glass windows and doors that adorn the entrance to the building.

You see security guards carefully pacing several yards back from the entrance. They are vastly outnumbered, and while your company could easily take the building, it is as if an imaginary line is drawn across the entrance now strewn with broken glass.

Far beyond the security guards, cowering in the darkness of one of the corners of the lobby, you see several civilians trying their best not to be seen. They work at CNN. One is a reporter. Not the kind of reporter that documents the type of event going on right now, live, in the midst of the action. She is usually in an air conditioned set giving opinions on the state of the nation. Right now there are no cameras and there is no broadcast. Her work day ended 6 hours ago, but the protests have kept her from getting safely home. It is now midnight. Her son is at home waiting for her. She usually gets home at a little past 6 o'clock. He is on Twitter, refreshing every couple seconds trying to get updates on the protest, posting comments on any thread that pops up asking what is going on at the building his mom works at.

You leave. It's dark out. It's been dark out. You're tired. Protestors stay and chant and break glass and spray paint the CNN sign. You've had enough of it. You want to go home.

Later the next day, you hear that a shop owner was injured trying to keep looters out of her store. She was a grandmother, in her early 70s. Someone broke a two-by-four over her head when she tried to push them away. No justice, no peace.

Days later a police officer was shot in the back of the head while trying to disperse a group of protestors. A couple facts about him: he is 29 years old, he has a wife and kids, and he will most likely be on a ventilator for the rest of his life. No justice, no peace.

You're hurt and confused. This isn't what you wanted. You hear people telling you that you're a part of this now. You need to vote this way. You need to boycott these places. You need to hate these people.

Hate.

Isn't that what caused this whole problem?

Hate, and violence, and intolerance. And picking a side. And sticking to it no matter what because it's your side now.

You can't. You know, deep down, that you can't.

It would be so easy. To let go and let your feelings sweep you into this churning mass of euphoric dogma. To join the movement and do what you're told.

But a little part of you knows deep down that you can't. It isn't really you. It isn't really what you believe in.

Parts of it ring true. No hate. No violence. No intolerance. Justice. Mercy. Love.

But you see your movement violating those principles you are starting to hold dearly.

You realize that you can't allow yourself be a part of this.

You have to think for yourself. You have to choose what you believe in. You have to be your own movement.
