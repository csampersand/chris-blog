How little can I get by with? How does it affect my mental processes? What are the benefits of reducing the amount of decisions and physical clutter I deal with on a daily basis?

I want to find out.

First, clothes. I don't have to wait until I have all my grail clothing items to slim down my wardrobe. I'll choose a limited subsection of my wardrobe and determine to get by just using them. Everything else will stay clean and unused. I'll limit my space to one drawer in my dresser for everything I'm allowed to wear. Gradually, I can switch clothing items out or upgrade items as needed. After doing this for a week or two, I should have a pretty good idea of what my needs are and how to optimize.

Next, I'll do this with shoes. Three pairs only. The rest will stay in a box.

Then, jackets. I'll allow myself one.

Finally, after a month of tweaking my adjusted wardrobe, I'll give away or sell all the clothes I've been able to live without.

The end goal:

**Bottoms**

- 1 pair pants
- 1 pair shorts
- 4 pairs underwear
- 2 pairs socks

**Tops**

- 2 tees
- 1 tank
- 1 long sleeve
- 1 jacket

**Shoes**

- Flip flops
- Running shoes
- Hiking boots

**Accessories**

- Poncho
- Shemagh
- Baseball cap
- Sunglasses

Next will be furniture. Then kitchen supplies. And then whatever else I own.
